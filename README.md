# BottleBrain
BottleBrain is my attempt to build a small, highly specialized tokenizer and category engine for liquor store products. It focuses on reliable text normalization (size, pack, flavor, type) and will eventually support a trainable mini-model with incremental learning. Rough around the edges as I learn to improve it!
